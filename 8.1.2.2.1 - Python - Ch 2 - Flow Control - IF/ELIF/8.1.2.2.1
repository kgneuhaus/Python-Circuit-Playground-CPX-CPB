x is not y   # x is not the same as y

Challenge # 1
----------------------------------------------------
Can you explain?

What do the following mean?
1) Assignment, 
sets a variable equal to something. uses one "="
2) Comparison, 
compares the value of 2 variables (must be integers)., uses two "=="
3) Evaluation, 
computes the value of a statement, written ex: 25+33
4) What is the difference between "=" and "==", 
"=" assigns "==" compares
5) Boolean,
a data type that can only be true or false
